  ======================== chap1page5.html =====================================

  Due: end of term, fall 2021
  This HTML submission is Phase 1 of Software Engineering.

  We are creating a web-based storybook designed to assist in learning the 
  Mi'kmaq language.  The storybook will contain an initial menu page, three 
  choose-from-3 option pages and a final page that plays the story chosen.  It 
  should integrate pictures, text and audio to immerse the students in an 
  interactive environment. 
  This software will use Java, JavaScript, Html5, CSS3 and react.js. There will
  be audio for the words to be played so that users can correctly speak the 
  words. HTML5 and CSS3 will be used to design the pages with visual inputs 
  such as pictures. JavaScript will be used for page interaction such as words
  and audio.  Nodejs/react.js will be used for server/backend development.

                            (Replay) Our story begins down by the river. 
                            It is a sunny day and I decided to go to the river 
                            to do some <em>fishing.</em> 
                            <br>
                            I caught 5 trout. This was enough
                            for my family to have a big feast. Down the river 
                            I saw a wounded <em>Bear.</em> 
                            <br>
                            I saw that the bear was weak and hungry, 
                            so I decided to <em>Give fish.</em> 
                            <br>
                            I gave the bear 2 fish, and he began to eat. 
                            After eating the fish, the bear began to walk away. 
                            Looking back the bear nodded its head at me, and I was happy. 
                            I went home and told my family <em>
                                The truth. </em>
                            <br>
                            My family was proud that I helped the wounded bear, 
                            but they told me to be careful next time because it
                            may be dangerous to feed wounded animals. 
                            I made a new friend that day with the bear and still
                            had enough fish for my family to eat.
