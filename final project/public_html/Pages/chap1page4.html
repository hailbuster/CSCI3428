    ======================== chap1page4.html =====================================
  
    Due: end of term, fall 2021
    This HTML submission is Phase 1 of Software Engineering.
  
    We are creating a web-based storybook designed to assist in learning the 
    Mi'kmaq language.  The storybook will contain an initial menu page, three 
    choose-from-3 option pages and a final page that plays the story chosen.  It 
    should integrate pictures, text and audio to immerse the students in an 
    interactive environment. 
    This software will use Java, JavaScript, Html5, CSS3 and react.js. There will
    be audio for the words to be played so that users can correctly speak the 
    words. HTML5 and CSS3 will be used to design the pages with visual inputs 
    such as pictures. JavaScript will be used for page interaction such as words
    and audio.  Nodejs/react.js will be used for server/backend development.

                            I gave the bear 2 fish, and he began to eat. After eating the
