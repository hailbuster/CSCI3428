                        (Replay) Our story begins down by the river.
                        It is a sunny day and I decided to go to the river
                        to do some <em>fishing.</em>
                        <br>
                        I caught 5 trout. This was enough
                        for my family to have a big feast. Down the river
                        I saw a wounded <em>Bear.</em>
                        <br>
                        I saw that the bear was weak and hungry,
                        so I decided to <em>Give fish.</em>
                        <br>
                        I gave the bear 2 fish, and he began to eat.
                        After eating the fish, the bear began to walk away.
                        Looking back the bear nodded its head at me, and I was happy.
                        I went home and told my family <em>
                            The truth. </em>
                        <br>
                        My family was proud that I helped the wounded bear,
                        but they told me to be careful next time because it
                        may be dangerous to feed wounded animals.
                        I made a new friend that day with the bear and still
                        had enough fish for my family to eat.
